## Hi there 👋 I'm Bruno

I'm a **Software Engineer** based in Brazil.

Thinking about ways to improve things or make them easier is kinda natural at this point. Building and bringing ideas to life is one of the most satisfying things for me.

My professional tech stack includes C#, .NET (Framework & Core), SQL Server, JavaScript, React, and Angular. I also enjoy messing around with different technologies, learning new stuff is a lot of fun.
